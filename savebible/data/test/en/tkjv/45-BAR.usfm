\v 1 And these are the words of the book, which Baruch the son of Nerias, the son of Maasias, the son of Sedecias, the son of
Asadias, the son of Chelcias, wrote in Babylon,
\p
\v 2 In the fifth year, and in the seventh day of the month, what time as the Chaldeans took Jerusalem, and burnt it with fire.
\p
\v 3 And Baruch did read the words of this book in the hearing of Jechonias the son of Joachim king of Juda, and in the ears of
all the people that came to hear the book,
\p
\v 4 And in the hearing of the nobles, and of the king’s sons, and in the hearing of the elders, and of all the people, from
the lowest unto the highest, even of all them that dwelt at Babylon by the river Sud.
\p
\v 5 Whereupon they wept, fasted, and prayed before the Lord.
\p
\v 6 They made also a collection of money according to every man’s power:
\p

all the people which were found with him at Jerusalem,

\v 1 Therefore the Lord hath made good his word, which he pronounced against us, and against our judges that judged Israel, and
against our kings, and against our princes, and against the men of Israel and Juda,
\p
\v 2 To bring upon us great plagues, such as never happened under the whole heaven, as it came to pass in Jerusalem, according
to the things that were written in the law of Moses;
\p
\v 3 That a man should eat the flesh of his own son, and the flesh of his own daughter.
